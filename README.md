INSIGHTS	
Seasonal and Trend-Based Churn Patterns: The line chart of the churn rate by month reveal seasonal patterns or specific times of the year when churn rates spike, indicating periods where targeted retention efforts could be most beneficial	
	
Lease Term Preferences and their Impact on Retention: The frequency distribution of lease terms highlights tenants’ preferences, showing whether shorter or longer leases correlate with higher retention rates, suggesting adjustments to lease offerings	
	
Direct Correlation between Tenant Satisfaction and Retention: Analysis from the bar chart showing satisfaction scores and the combo chart correlating churn status with satisfaction scores by property type provides concrete evidence that higher satisfaction levels are crucial for reducing churn rates.	
	
Financial efficiency and its role in overall property performance : Rent collection performance insights can highlight operational efficiencies or issues affecting the company's financial health and its ability to invest in property improvements and tenant services	
	
Effectiveness of Renewal Strategies Over Time: The comparison of renewed versus expired leases over time can indicate the success of recent retention strategies or highlight the need for new approaches.	
	
	
RECOMMENDATIONS:	
Implement Targeted Retention Programs: Based on identified churn patterns, develop targeted retention programs during high-risk periods, such as personalised communication, special offers or community events to engage tenants	
	
Adjust Lease Terms to Meet Customer Preferences: If certain lease length correlate with higher retention, consider offering more flexible or preferred lease terms to new and renewing tenants to encourage longer stays	
	
Enhance Tenant Satisfaction: Prioritise improvements in areas directly impacting tenant satisfaction a identified through survey responses. This could include property amenities, maintenance responsiveness and community building efforts,	
	
Optimize financial Operations: Address any identified inefficiencies in rent collection to improve financial stability. Consider implementing technology solutions for easier payment processes or offering incentives for on time payments.
